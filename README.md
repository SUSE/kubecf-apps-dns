# KubeCF Apps DNS

This is the Apps DNS for KubeCF. It's a CoreDNS plugin that performs service
discovery using the Service Discovery Controller and responds with discovered
routes.

This repository also contains the Dockerfile for building a minimal CoreDNS
binary with only the required plugins for KubeCF.
